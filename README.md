# UFO Sightings Analysis

### Project Overview
This projects aims to explore trends and patterns in UFO sightings from NUFORC's UFO Sighthings Dataset. By analyzing aspects of the UFO Sightings Data, I hope to answer the following the questions:

1. Which countries report the most UFO Sightings?
2. How has number of sightings changed overtime?
3. What are the most commonly reported UFO shape?
4. What time of day and month have the highest probability of UFO sightings?

### Data Sources

Ufo Sightings Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "ufo_sightings_scrubbed.csv", containing information about ufo sightings reported to NUFORC

### Tools
**Languages:**
* Python (Data Analysis and Visualization)

**Libraries**
* Numpy (Numerical Operation)
* Pandas (Data Cleaning)
* Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly (Data Visualization)

### Data Cleaning
In the data cleaning phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Dropping irrelevant columns
2. Dropping duplicated data
3. Reformatting country column
4. Handling nulls in country column
5. Converting columns into the right datatype
6. Split datetime column into date and time respectively
7. Removing Outliers
